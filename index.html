                Greetings, everyone!
                I am Shyamala Deepika, currently in my final year of pursuing a BTech degree at Raghu Engineering College. My academic performance has been commendable, and I have a keen interest in various technical activities such as HackerRank, CodeChef, and others, alongside my regular subjects.
                During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to complete an internship focused on AI using Python, where I worked on two projects involving predictions using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Regression. Additionally, I have undertaken internships through AICTE, delving into Robotics and Cloud Computing, which further fueled my passion for technology.
                An enthusiastic learner with a strong curiosity for development, I am continuously exploring new technologies and honing my programming skills. I aspire to become a Full Stack Developer and have already embarked on my journey by learning Front-End Development from various reputable sources.
                I am excited about my future in web development and look forward to embracing new challenges and opportunities that come my way!
                 <br>

              <h5> Project 1 : </h5>
              <br>
              Project idea –
              The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous wrecks in history. On April 15, 1912,
              during her maiden voyage, the RMS Titanic, widely considered “unsinkable”, sank after
              hitting an iceberg. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats for everyone on board,
              resulting in the deaths of 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew. While there was an
              element of luck in survival, it appears that certain groups of people were more likely to
              survive than others.
              You have to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on data such as
              their age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. For example, it is highly probable that someone
              rich from the first-class survived as compared to someone from the third class. You can use
              the Titanic dataset on Kaggle for this project. And just to make things more interesting, this
              dataset contains real data based on the people who died and survived the actual Titanic
              disaster.Use a classification technique ( Logistic regression, SVM OR Naïve Bayes) to predict
              whether a passenger will survive based on the characteristics of the data.

              <h5> Project 2 : </h5> 
              <br>
              Project idea – The dataset has house prices of the Melbourne. There are a lot of factors
              that determine the price of a house including its location, size, number of rooms, etc.
              But people ignore many of these factors while buying or selling a house. That’s where
              this project comes in! It provides many factors for the house like it’s frontage, area,
              street, land contour, utilities, proximity, garage quality, roof materials, etc. with the
              ultimate aim of predicting the final price of the house based on these factors. You can
              get the Housing Prices Prediction Project dataset for on Kaggle and use it to create am
              ML algorithm that can accurately predict the house prices based on these factors.<br>

              <br>
              Project idea –Perform regression analysis to predict the profit of each the 50 startups mentioned in
              the dataset by taking all the input parameters(multi linear regression). The dataset
              consists of 5 columns where the ‘state’ column stores the categorical data points, and
              the rest are numerical features.
              Plot visuals by using Matplotlib/Seaborn data visualization comparing the different
              features of the input parameters and do Exploratory data analysis (EDA) by using
              pandas.<br>
